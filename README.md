# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

## How to Prebuild and Run Your Expo App

1. Generate Native Projects.  
   This creates the android/ and ios/ folders for your project:

   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild
   ```

2. Run on a Device or Emulator.  
   Depending on which platform you want to test, run:
   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   npx expo run:ios
   ```
3. Start the App with Dev Client
   If you want to run the prebuilt version using Expoâ€™s development client:

   You only need to prebuild again if you add or change native modules. Otherwise, you can just use --dev-client to run your app.

   ```bash
   npx expo start --dev-client
   ```

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
